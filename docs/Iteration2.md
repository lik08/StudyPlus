# Iteration 2

## This Iteration
This iteration we have completed some features that will finally be interconnected in the next 
iteration. The big thing we did was started implementing the database.  We still have not fully 
implemented it for everything we do (we plan to include course tags, which allow us to search and
link quizzes, courses, and questions together), but we are hoping to get to that next iteration. You
can create a course and "organize" yourself as a student. Additionally you are now able to quiz 
yourself on questions you may have. The plan is to be able to organize questions into multiple 
quizzes by courses once course tags is implemented.


## Features Finished:
- Cue Card System
- Course Organization

## Features Started but Not Finished:
- Question Bank
  - edit a question
- Quiz Game
- Timer

## Discarded Feature
- Profile

## User Stories Finished:
- Display Courses
- Edit Courses
- Delete Courses
- Add Courses
- Display Quiz

Note For Marker:
Right now the course tabs seems to be empty. Once we implement Course Tags and connect it with 
questions, the goal is to have questions that only belong to a specific course show up.

## User Stories Started but Not Finished:
- Delete Quiz
- Edit Quiz
- Create Quiz
- Quiz Score
- Edit Question

### Architecture Document

## Next Iteration
In the third iteration we would like to :
- Implement the following features:
  - Courses Tag so we can connect questions and courses together
- Polish the following features:
  - Timer
  - Quiz Game
- If we have time we would like to:
  - Filter/Search so we can sort lists of items
