# Retrospective

# Discussion

Throughout the duration of the projection, there were several issues that we ran into:
One of these issues is time management. The group as a whole struggled with this, which ultimately led to rushed software development, bugs, failing tests, and blocking of other tasks. The way we will handle this issue is to set hard deadlines throughout the iteration and regularly schedule meetings to hold each other accountable. Another way we will address this issue is giving more time for tasks and doing a deeper analysis of them as well. By doing this we will be giving ourselves more time to think through our code and understanding the task at hand. This should ultimately lead to avoiding bugs and/or crashes that may occur otherwise. This can be measured by the progress mentioned at each meeting and checking off expected completed assigned tasks.

Another issue that occurred throughout the project was poor peer reviews, which led to bugs and failing tests. As a group, we did not review the code properly before approving the merge requests or sometimes merged the request without someone else looking at it. This iteration we will be aiming to create a more formal process to deal with this issue. Code will not be allowed to be merged in unless approved. We plan to have each reviewer pull and test the merge request or have a demo shown before approving the merge request. This will lead to high quality code and less bugs. This can be measured by looking at each merge request and ensuring that at least one person has reviewed before merging.
