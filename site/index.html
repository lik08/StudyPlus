                            studying.

                    <h3>Who are the users?</h3>
                    <p>
                        StudyPlus is designed to be engaging and enjoyable for any individual
                        looking to broaden their knowledge about a specific topic. While StudyPlus
                        can be used by anyone with an interest in learning, it is primarily designed
                        for students. StudyPlus allows its learners to organize and access course
                        material in one place. Additionally, they will be able to assess their
                        knowledge through practice assessments.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What do we want to accomplish?</h3>
                    <p>
                        StudyPlus allows you to take your studying on the go while also giving
                        learners a way to store their studying materials. This allows students
                        to go back and forth between the things like practice assessments and
                        their flash cards at their discretion. Motivation is one of the biggest
                        issues students face throughout their academic journey. StudyPlus aims to
                        motivate learners and reduce burnout by making studying a more fun and
                        enjoyable experience. Another objective is to increase accessibility.
                        Learners typically find small excuses such as having to carry around
                        notebooks or large devices to avoid studying. StudyPlus will aim to reduce
                        the number of barriers that students face and hence promoting studying.

                    <h3>What would you do differently, if you had the chance to start over?</h3>
                    <p>
                        If we had the chance to start over, we would put a lot more time and effort in
                        the beginning stages of
                        building our application. We should have spent more time developing a roadmap as
                        well as laying out the
                        overall architecture before actually coding and developing the application. We
                        ran into so many
                        problems and issues which resulted in so many pivots and changes of our plans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The number of features and the complexities of each were also just too much for
                        the amount of time we
                        had. We should have built simpler features that were well developed, scale, and
                        interact with other
                        parts of our app fluidly.

                    <h3>What went wrong in the development process?</h3>
                    <p>
                        One area that could have been improved during the development process was the
                        planning of the
                        overall project as well as the planning before every iteration. The group
                        struggled to keep on pace with
                        what was discussed during the planning stages which ultimately led to a
                        multitude of problems with work
                        distribution, time management, and organization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The work distribution and time management problems were a result of not
                        understanding the scope and
                        size of the features and associated tasks. We were too ambitious and as we
                        continued to build our project,
                        we ran into a lot of issues with crashes and bugs which ended up shortening the
                        amount of time we had.
                        This led to cutting certain functionalities of features and frantic development.
                    </p>

                <div class="col-md-6" id="postmortem-col3">
                    <h3>What took the most time?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Setting up the database during iteration two ended up being a lot harder than
                        anticipated.
                        After fiddling with our database for many hours, we eventually had it correctly
                        implemented in our project
                        for iteration two. As we were developing more features and functionalities for
                        iteration three, we ran into
                        a lot of bugs and ended up consuming a lot of time that could have been spent
                        developing more features.
                        In hindsight, we should have spent more time developing a better ER diagram,
                        which would have saved us time down the road.

                <div class="col-md-6" id="postmortem-col4">
                    <h3>How did the project change?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of our project has not changed, but the number of features and
                        functions we wanted to implement changed throughout the project.
                        The main features that we wanted to implement and were able to was a practice
                        assessment tool (quiz feature) and a flash card system.
                        We also wanted a way for our users to organize their studying materials, which
                        is done through course organization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One feature that didn't make it in time that we hope to include in the future,
                        is the ability to create profiles which also
                        includes progress reports. This would have allowed our users to track their
                        progress as well as informing them on areas of strengths
                        and weaknesses to shift their studying accordingly.
